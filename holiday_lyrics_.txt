Jingle Bell Rock Lyrics
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowin' and blowin' up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air
What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh

Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet
That's the jingle bell rock

What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh

Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet
That's the jingle bell rock3EmbedThe Christmas Song (Merry Christmas to You) LyricsChestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that santa's on his way -
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And ev'rymother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so i'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although its been said many times
Many ways: "merry christmas to you"
EmbedIt’s Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas Lyrics
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
Take a look at the five and ten
It's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door
A pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben;
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen;
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

Sure it's Christmas once more5EmbedChristmas in Hollis Lyrics
It was December 24th on Hollis Ave after dark
When I seen a man chilling with his dog in the park
I approached him very slowly with my heart full of fear
Looked at his dog, oh my God, a ill reindeer
But then I was illin' 'cause the man had a beard
And a bag full of goodies, 12 o'clock had neared
So I turned my head a second and the man was gone
But he must’ve dropped his wallet smack dead on the lawn
I picked the wallet up but then I took a pause
Took out the license and it cold said "Santa Claus"
A million dollars in it, cold hundreds of G's
Enough to buy a boat and matching car with ease
But I'd never steal from Santa, cause that ain't right
So I'm going home to mail it back to him that night
But when I got home I bugged, cause under the tree
Was a letter from Santa and the dough was for me
It's Christmas time in Hollis, Queens
Mom's cookin' chicken and collard greens
Rice and stuffing, macaroni and cheese
And Santa put gifts under Christmas trees
Decorate the house with lights at night
Snow's on the ground, snow white so bright
In the fireplace is the yule log
Beneath the mistletoe as we drink eggnog
The rhymes that you hear are the rhymes of Darryl's
But each and every year we bust Christmas carols
Christmas melodies

Rhymes so loud and proud you hear it
It's Christmas time and we got the spirit
Jack Frost chillin', the hawk is out
And that's what Christmas is all about
The time is now, the place is here
And the whole wide world is filled with cheer

My name's D.M.C. with the mic in my hand
And I'm chilling and coolin' just like a snowman
So open your eyes, lend us an ear
We want to say
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!15EmbedJingle bells - 1996 - remaster LyricsDashing through the snow
On a one-horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go
Laughing all the way;
Bells on bob-tail ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
A day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side;
The horse was lean and lank;
Misfortune seemed his lot;
He got into a drifted bank
And we, we got upsot
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells
Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
A day or two ago
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh
He laughed as there
I sprawling lie
But quickly drove away
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells
Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young
Take the girls tonight
And sing this sleighing song;
Just get a bob-tailed bay
Two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! you'll take the lead
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells
Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleighEmbedWonderful Christmastime  - 2011 Remaster LyricsThe mood is right

You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch
You really are a heel
You're as cuddly as a cactus, you're as charming as an eel, Mr. Grinch
You're a bad banana with a greasy black peel!

You're a monster, Mr. Grinch
Your heart's an empty hole
Your brain is full of spiders, you've got garlic in your soul, Mr. Grinch
I wouldn't touch you with a thirty-nine-and-a-half foot pole!
You're a vile one, Mr. Grinch
You have termites in your smile
You have all the tender sweetness of a seasick crocodile, Mr. Grinch
Given a choice between the two of you I'd take the seasick crocodile!

You're a foul one, Mr. Grinch
You're a nasty-wasty skunk
Your heart is full of unwashed socks, your soul is full of gunk, Mr. Grinch
The three words that best describe you are as follows, and I quote
"Stink, stank, stunk!"

You're a rotter, Mr. Grinch
You're the king of sinful sots
Your heart's a dead tomato splotched with moldy purple spots, Mr. Grinch
Your soul is an appalling dump heap overflowing with the most disgraceful
Assortment of deplorable rubbish imaginable, mangled up in tangled up knots!

You nauseate me, Mr. Grinch
With a nauseous super "naus"!
You're a crooked dirty jockey and you drive a crooked hoss, Mr. Grinch
You're a three decker sauerkraut and toadstool sandwich with arsenic sauce!7EmbedA Pimp’s Christmas Song Lyrics

The bloody Red Baron was flying once more
The Allied command ignored all of its men
And called on Snoopy to do it again
Twas the night before Christmas, 40 below
When Snoopy went up in search of his foe
He spied the Red Baron, fiercely they fought
With ice on his wings Snoopy knew he was caught
Christmas bells those Christmas bells
Ring out from the land
Asking peace of all the world
And good will to man
The Baron had Snoopy dead in his sights
He reached for the trigger to pull it up tight
Why he didn't shoot, well, we'll never know
Or was it the bells from the village below
Christmas bells those Christmas bells
Ringing through the land
Bringing peace to all the world
And good will to man
The Baron made Snoopy fly to the Rhine
And forced him to land behind the enemy lines
Snoopy was certain that this was the end
When the Baron cried out, "Merry Christmas, my friend"
The Baron then offered a holiday toast
And Snoopy, our hero, saluted his host
And then with a roar they were both on their way
Each knowing they'd meet on some other day
Christmas bells those Christmas bells
Ringing through the land
Bringing peace to all the world
And good will to man
Christmas bells those Christmas bells
Ringing through the land
Bringing peace to all the world
And good will to manEmbedThis Christmas Lyrics

Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls
Soakin’ it all in
Then we go hit the mall
Even though we ain’t ballin’
Feel like we bought it all
The mistletoe’s right here
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus

Merry Christmas to all, and all a good night
Huh, now we all livin’ the good life
Yeah, though it’s forty below the wind chill
And we wipin’ snow up off the windshield
It’s still wonderful night to be alive, baby
And I’m so happy I’m with my baby
And we a little late with the Christmas gifts
Rushin’ for the mall, don’t trip, you know I drive crazy
The streets lit up, it feel like Christmas officially
Told her that “You the star at the top of my Christmas tree”
My only question is, “Where my presents?”
She said, “Shhh,” she got a gift for me that ain’t for the kids to see
Well, I like the way you think, mami
Now pour some more eggnog in your drink, mami
You've been a bad girl, give Santa three kisses
Gave her the hot chocolate, she said, “It’s Dee-ricious”
Hahahaha, yeah
Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls (Uh, uh)
Soakin’ it all in
Then we go hit the mall (I'm like Bad Santa though)
Even though we ain’t ballin’ (Somebody sit on my lap)
Feel like we bought it all
The mistletoe’s right here
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus

Yeah, Mom and Dad, I won't be home for the holidays
Ha, I’m over 800 miles away
In the city that's so pretty
Where the hustlers dash through the snow without a sleigh
Tell my family that I’m sorry that I gotta stay
I’m with Ye at the Macy Day Parade
Lettin' the snow fall on my aviator shades
Even though I’m in New York, I’m still reppin' for the A
Cyhi!

Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls
Soakin’ it all in
Then we go hit the mall
Even though we ain’t ballin’
Feel like we bought it all
The mistletoe’s right here
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus
All the flashin' lights up on a tree
The house lit up nice
With your family is where you wanna be
Here on Christmas night
When you wake up and you see the gifts
Don’t that make you feel good?
So since we all snowed in in Harlem
Let’s have Christmas in the hood

All of the flashin' lights
Yeah, them things shine so bright
Always for you and me
Baby, you’re Christmas Eve
If you like what you see
Won’t you come sit on my knee?
And tell me everything that you want
‘Cause, baby, I’m your Santa Claus, yeah

Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls
Soakin’ it all in
Then we go hit the mall
Even though we ain’t ballin’
Feel like we bought it all
The mistletoe’s right here
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus1EmbedLast Christmas Lyrics
(Happy Christmas)
Ah, ah-ah
Ooh-woah
Oh-oh

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)
Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby, do you recognise me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
"Happy Christmas," I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying, "I love you," I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special, oh)
Oh, oh, baby

A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face of a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover, but you tore me apart
Ooh-ooh
Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave me away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart (I gave you my heart)
A man undercover, but you tore him apart
Maybe next year
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special

Special
Someone
Someone
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special
Who give me something in return
(I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone)
Hold my heart and watch it burn
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special
I thought you were here to stay
How could you love me for a day?
I thought you were someone special
I gave you my heart
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
You gave it away
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone

Santa baby, just slip a sable under the tree
For me
Been an awful good girl
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa baby, a '54 convertible too
Light blue
I'll wait up for you dear
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight
Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the fellas that I haven't kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you'll check off my Christmas list

Santa baby, I want a yacht
And really that's not a lot
Been an angel all year
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa honey, one little thing I really need
The deed
To a platinum mine
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa cutie, and fill my stocking with a duplex
And checks
Sign your 'X' on the line
Santa cutie, and hurry down the chimney tonight

Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany
I really do believe in you
Let's see if you believe in me
Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing
A ring
I don't mean on the phone
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

Hurry down the chimney tonight
Hurry, tonight4EmbedAll I Want for Christmas Is You Lyrics
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, yeah

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need (And I)
Don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace (Ah)

Holding on to me so tight (Ooh)
What more can I do?

The spinning don't stop when you leave the cradle
You just slow down
Round and around the world you go
Spinning through the lives of the people you know
We all slow down
How you gonna keep on turnin' from day to day?
How you gonna keep from turnin' your life away?
No days you can borrow, no time you can buy
No trust in tomorrow, it's a lie
I feel like a spinning top or a dreidel
The spinning don't stop when you leave the cradle
You just slow down
Round and around the world you go
Spinning through the lives of the people you know
We all slow down
How you gonna keep on turnin' from day to day?
How you gonna keep from turnin' your life away?
And I feel like I'm dippin' and divin'
My sky shoes are spiked with lead heels
I'm lost in this star car I'm drivin'
But my air sole keeps pushin' big wheels
My world is a constant confusion
My mind is prepared to attack
My past, a persuasive illusion
I'm watchin' the future it's black
What do you know? You know just what you perceive
What can you show? Nothing of what you believe
And as you grow, each thread of life that you leave
Will spin around your deeds and dictate your needs
As you sell your soul and you sow your seeds
And you wound yourself and your loved one bleeds
And your habits grow, and your conscience feeds
On all that you thought you should be
I never thought this could happen to me
I feel like a spinning top or a dreidel
The spinnin' don't stop when you leave the cradle
You just slow down
Round and around this world you go
Spinnin' through the lives of the people you know
We all slow down
How you gonna keep on turning from day to day?
How you gonna keep from turning your life away?
I feel like a spinning top or a dreidel
The spinning don't stop when you leave the cradle
You just slow downEmbedAlways on Time Lyrics
Always there when you call (Buckshots, ha), always on time
Gave you my, baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby

Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine
C'mon and get a piece of this late-night lover
You know, the one that swing dick like no other
I know, I got a lot of things I need to explain
But, baby, you know the name, and love is about pain
So, stop the complaints and drop the order restraints
Our sex life's a game, so back me down in the paint
'Cause I can't wait no more
'Cause it's about a quarter past three and shorty's eyeing me
I got the Bentley valeted
And I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades
And I'd love to see that ass in boots and shades
Throw down on the bed while I'm yanking your braids
Thug style, you never thought I'd make you smile
While I'm smacking your ass and fucking you all wild
But we share something so rare, but who cares, you care

Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine

Girl, get a grip, c'mon, pull it together
It's only a sunshower, we been through worse weather
Like the stormy nights you wrote a Dear Ja letter
And took my Benz and keyed and cut the leather
Bitch, you know better, we live M-O-B
Money over bitches, Murder, I-N-C
I got two or three hoes for every V
And I keep 'em drugged up off that ecstasy
I'm a playground legend like Kirkland Pee-wee
Name a nigga in the league got more game than me
I play hard, there's so many women I fathered
Meet 'em with scars and send 'em home hot and bothered
Truth or dare, this life ain't apparently fair
And a love with no glare is a crystal stare
But we share something so rare, but who cares, you care
Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine

Oh, I'm feeling like you living a double life
Cause you don't be coming home sometimes
Baby, but you're always on time, checking for one time
You and I got a special bond together
We go back like bombers, boo, in the coldest weather
And when I play, you play the same way
You freak me, baby, I fuck you crazy, then I'm gone
Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy
She'll be wakin' up wet for sheezy
Remind these bitches to mind they business
Believe me, this pimp game is very religious
And I'm built like the Don Bishop
Gon' keep this money-green Benz and my hoes as my witness
The life we share is a thug affair
But who cares, you care

Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby be mine

Here at W-I-Z, we play nothing but the hits, nothing but the hits
Nothing but the motherfucking hits24EmbedJumpin’, Jumpin’ Lyrics
Ladies, leave your man at home

And all you fellas, leave your girl with her friends
'Cause it's eleven thirty and the club is jumpin', jumpin'

Though he say he got a girl
Yeah, it's true, you got a man
But the party ain't gon' stop
So let's make it hot, hot
Last weekend, you stayed at home alone and lonely
Couldn't find your man, he was chillin' with his homies
This weekend you're goin' out
If he try to stop you, you're goin' off
You got your hair done and your nails done too
A new outfit and your Fendi shoes
You and your crew parlayin' at the hottest spot
Tonight you're gonna
Find the fellas rollin' in the Lexus, trucks and Hummers

Though he say he got a girl
Yeah, it's true, you got a man
But the party ain't gon' stop
So let's make it hot, hot

And all you fellas, leave your girl with her friends
'Cause it's eleven thirty and the club is jumpin', jumpin'

But the party ain't gon' stop
So let's make it hot, hot

Call your boys, 'cause tonight you're not gon' stay at home
You should tell your girl she ain't comin' tonight, you going solo
Cut her off as she talk some noise
You know you got the right to get your party on
So get your haircut and your car washed too
Lookin' like a star in your Armani suit, you need to look your best
'Cause you're turnin' heads tonight
You're gonna find a sexy chica
That's gon' dance all night if you wanna

Shady
Konvict, Upfront
Akon, Slim Shady
I see the one, could she be that lady? Ayy

I feel you creepin', I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?
And possibly bend you over?
Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Upfront style, ready to attack now
Pull in the parking lot slow with the 'Lac down
Konvict's got the whole thing packed now
Step in the club, the wardrobe intact now
I feel it, dawnin' cracked now
Ooh, I see it dull and backed now
I'ma call her, then I put the mack down
Money no problem, pocket full of that now

I feel you creepin', I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?
And possibly bend you over?
Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Oh, looks like another club banger
They better hang on when they throw this thang on
Get a little drink on, they gon' flip
For this Akon shit, you can bank on it
Pedicure, manicure, kitty-cat claws
The way she climbs up and down them poles
Lookin' like one of them Putty-Cat Dolls
Tryin' to hold my woodie back through my drawers
Steps off stage, didn't think I saw her
Creeps up behind me, and she's like "You're—"
I'm like, "I know, let's cut to the chase
No time to waste, back to my place"
Plus from the club to the crib's like a mile away
Or more like a palace, shall I say
And plus, I got a pal if your gal is game
In fact, he's the one singin' the song that's playin' (Akon!)
I feel you creepin', I can see it from my shadow (My shadow)
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo? (Like Tae Bo?)
And possibly bend you over? (Ooh, yeah)

Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more (Yeah)
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Yeah, yeah)

Eminem's rollin', D and 'em rollin'
Bu and all marvelous, them rollin'
Women just ho-in', big booty rollin'
Soon, I'll be all in them and throwin' D (D)
Hittin' no less than three (Three)
Block wheel style like whee (Whee)
Girl, I can tell you want me, 'cause lately

I feel you creepin', I can see it from my shadow (Yeah, my shadow)
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo? (Like Tae Bo?)
And possibly bend you over? (Ooh, yeah)

Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh58EmbedTipsy - radio mix Lyrics
Teen drinking is very bad
Yo I got a fake ID though
Yeeah, yeeah, yeeah, yo, 2 step with me, 2 step with me

1, here comes the 2 to the 3 to the 4
Everybody drunk out on the dance floor
Babygirl ass jiggle like she want more
Like she a groupie and I ain't even on tour
Maybe cause she heard that I rhyme hardcore
Or maybe cause she heard that I buy out the stores
Bottom of the 9th and a nigga gotta score
If not i gotta move on to the next floor 
Here comes the 3 to the 2 to the 1
Homeboy trippin' he don't know I got a gun
When it come to pop man we do shit for fun
You ain't got one nigga you betta run
Now i'm in the back gettin head from my hunz
While she goin down i'm breakin down what i done
She smokin my blunt sayin she ain't havin fun
Bitch give it back now you don't get none

Now everybody in the club  gettin tipsy
Everybody in the club  gettin tipsy

2, here comes the 3 to the 4 to the 5
Now i'm lookin at shorty right in the eyes
Couple seconds passed now i'm lookin at her thighs
While she tellin me how much she hate her guy
Said she got a kid but she got her tubes tied
If you 21 girl that's alright
I wonder if a shake comin with them fries
If so baby can i get em super sized
Here comes the 4 to the 3 to the 2
She started feelin on my johnson right out the blue
Girl you super thick so i'm thinkin that's koo
But instead of 1 lifestyle i need 2
Her eyes got big when she glanced at my jewels
Expression on her face like she ain't got a clue
And she told me she don't run with a crew
You know how i do but i guess one gotta do

3, here comes the 4 to the 5 to the 6
Self explanatory I ain't gotta say i'm rich
This single man ain't tryna get hitched
Nigga waste it on me man son of a bitch
Brushed it all off now i'm back to gettin lit
Grisa orange juice man this some good ish
Homeboy trippin cause i'm starin at his chick
Now he on the sideline starin at my clique
Here comes the 5 to the 4 to the 3
Hands in the air if you cats drunk as me
Club on the set kwon cut out them trees
Dude i don't care i'm a p.i.m.p

Everybody in the club  gettin tipsy EmbedMilkshake Lyrics

Yo, man
Yo
Open up, man
Yo, what you want, man?
My girl just caught me
You made her catch you?
I don't know how I let this happen
With who?
The girl next door, ya know?
Man
I don't know what to do
Say it wasn't you
Alright
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time she was standin' there
She never took her eyes off me

How ya fi give the woman access to your villa?
Trespasser and a witness, all the hacklin' a yuh pillow
You better watch your back before she turn into a killa
Best review the situation that you caught up inna
To be a true player, you haffi know how fi play
If she say, "A night," convince her, say, "A day"
Never admit to a word weh she say
And if she claim a yuh, tell her, "Baby, no way!"

But she caught me on the counter (Wasn't me)
Saw me bangin' on the sofa (Wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (Wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (Wasn't me)
She saw the marks on my shoulder (Wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her (Wasn't me)
Heard the screams gettin' louder (Wasn't me)
She stayed until it was over
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
I had tried to keep her from what
She was about to see
Why should she believe me
When I told her it wasn't me?

Mek she know say that she really no have right fi vex
A never you she see yah make the gigolo flex
A smaddy else weh favor you inna di complex
Seein' is believin', so you better change your specs
You know she a go bring a whole heap a things up from the past
All the likkle evidence, you betta know fi mask
Quick 'pon yuh answer, know how fi talk
But if she pack a gun, you know you betta run fast

But she caught me on the counter (Wasn't me)
Saw me bangin' on the sofa (Wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (It wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (Wa-wasn't me)
She saw the marks on my shoulder (Wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her (Wasn't me)
Heard the screams gettin' louder (Wasn't me)
She stayed until it was over
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time she was standin' there
She never took her eyes off me

Gonna tell her that I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused
I've been listenin' to your reasonin', it makes no sense at all
Need to tell her that I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused
You may think that you're a player, but you're completely lost
That's why I sing

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time she was standin' there
She never took her eyes off me79EmbedSay My Name Lyrics
You could use a buddy
Don't you want a pal?
"Yes I do! Yes I do!"
Girl, the way I see it
Your daddy should be leavin'
And you should stick around
(spoken)
And kill him!
What?

Nothing. 
(sung)
So, Lydia, don't end yourself
Defend yourself
Daddy is the one you should maim
Together we'll exterminate, assassinate

No!

The finer points can wait
But first you gotta say my name!
Go ahead and jump but that won't stop him
Here you got a solid plan B option
I can bring your daddy so much pain
All you gotta do is say my name
Girl, just say it three times in a row
And you won't believe how far I'll go
I'm on the bench, but Coach—
Just put me in the game
All you gotta do is say my name
I don't know your name. 

Well, I can't say it. 

How 'bout a game of charades?

Yes, let's play it!

Two words...

Right. 

Second word?

Uh-huh. 

Drink?
No. 

Beverage?

No. 

Wine?

No!

Juice?!

Yes!

Okay. First word...

Okay. 

Bug?

No. 

Ant?

Close, but no. 

Beetle?

Yes!

Beetle-juice?

Wow, I'm impressed. And all you gotta do is say my name three times. Three times in a row, it must be spoken unbroken. Ready?

Yeah...

Okay, go. 

Betelgeuse...

Yes...

Betelgeuse...

Yes...

Bee—

Oh! Oh! This is gonna be so good!

—cause!

What?

You're so smart
A stand-up bro
I'll think about your offer
Let you know
But I prefer my chances down below
Betelgeuse

Yes!

Betelgeuse

Yes!

Being young and female
Doesn't mean that I'm an easy mark
I've been swimmin' with piranhas
I don't need a shark
Yes, life sucks
But not that much
Okay, Betelgeuse
Betelgeuse
Be a doll and spare the lecture

I'm offering you a full-time specter

Are you any good?

You betcha
Trust me, baby!

I just met ya
Really, it's a flattering offer

Don't you wanna see Dad suffer?

I think I'd rather just jump off

No!

I may be suicidal
But Betelgeuse, it's not as if I've lost my mind

So, playing hardball, huh? You are tougher than you look. 

Just wanna make sure I know who I'm working with. Got any references?

Lydia, there you are!

Are you alright?

A-Dog, B-Town, my old pals!

Get away from her! Lydia, this is a dangerously unstable individual. 


Betelgeuse is sexy!

Betelgeuse is smart!

BJ is a graduate of Juilliard!
He can help
We found him on Yelp
Our troubles all ended on the day that we befriended him
Every word is the truth
Betelgeuse, Betelgeuse, Betelgeuse!

What the heck was that?

So violating!

There you go, kid. Couple of five-star reviews. 

What was that?

That was possession. Any ghost can do that in less than one lesson. 

Any ghost?

Pretty much, any ghost'll do, sure. 

Then, Betelgeuse... what do I need you for?

Whoa, whoa
Whoa whoa whoa!
Hold up! Hold up, girl!
I'm your pal
They're sweet, but I'm a demon straight from Hell
I know, I went a little hard on the sell
But we're BF-F-F-F's forever!

Agh!

Lydia!

What? He was already dead. And you heard what he said, any ghost can do that possession stuff. 
(sung)
We don't need that demon
The three of us alone can wreck dad's evening
Together we can make a grown man weep
Guys, I got a dinner date to keep

Okay, so what's the plan?

Teach dad a lesson
He's gonna freak when we possess him
So, he wants the perfect daughter
I'll lead that lamb to slaughter
Yeah, I got game!
I'm gonna make him say my name
(Make him say your name)
I'll make him say my name
(Make him say your name)
I'll make him say my name
(Make him say your name)
Not running away!
I'll make him say my name!21EmbedLet Me Blow Ya Mind Lyrics
Uh, uh, uh, huh
Yo, yo

Drop your glasses, shake your asses
Face screwed up like you having hot flashes
Which one? Pick one, this one, classic
Red from blonde, yeah, bitch, I'm drastic
Why this, why that, lips stop askin'
Listen to me, baby, relax and start passin'
Expressway, hair back, weaving through the traffic
This one strong, should be labeled as a hazard
Some of y'all niggas hot, psych, I'm gassin'
Clowns, I spot 'em and I can't stop laughin'
Easy come, easy go, E-V gon' be lastin'
Jealousy, let it go, results could be tragic
Some of y'all ain't writing well, too concerned with fashion
None of you ain't Giselle, cat walk and imagine
A lot of y'all Hollywood, drama, casted
Cut bitch, camera off, real shit, blast it
If I had to give you more, it's only been a year
Now I've got my foot through the door, and I ain't going nowhere
It took a while to get me here, and I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear, now let me blow ya mind

They wanna bank up, crank up, makes me dizzy
Shank up, haters wanna come after me
You ain't a gangster, prankster, too much to eat
Snakes in my path wanna smile up at me (Huh)

Now why you gritting your teeth?
Frustration, baby, you got to breathe
Take a lot more than you to get rid of me
You see I do what they can't do, I just do me
Ain't no stress when it comes to stage, get what you see
Meet me in the lab, pen and pad, don't believe
Huh, 16's mine, create my own lines
Love for my wordplay that's hard to find
Sophomore, I ain't scared, one of a kind
All I do is contemplate ways to make your fans mine
Eyes bloodshot, stressing, chills up your spine
Huh, sick to your stomach wishing I wrote your rhymes
I knew I had to give you more, it's only been a year
Now I've got my foot through the door, and I ain't going nowhere
It took a while to get me here, and I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear, now let me blow ya mind

Let your bones crack
Your back pop, I can't stop
Excitement, Glock shots from your stash spot
Fuck it, thugged out, I respect the cash route
Glocked down, blasters, sets while I mash out
Yeah, nigga, mash out, D-R-E, huh
Backtrack, make that, E-V-E
Do you like that? (Ew) You got to I know you
Had you in a trance first glance from the floor too
Don't believe, I'll show you, take you with me
Turn you on, tension gone, give you relief
Put your trust in a bomb when you listen to me
Damn, she much thinner know now I'm complete (Uh-huh)
Still stallion, brick house, pile it on
Ryde or Die bitch, double R, came strong
Beware, 'cause I crush anything I land on
Me here, ain't no mistake, nigga, it was planned on

If I had to give you more, it's only been a year
Now I've got my foot through the door, and I ain't going nowhere
It took a while to get me here, and I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear, now let me blow ya mind27EmbedMove Ya Body Lyrics

Uh
Hey, Dirty (What?)
Look at that girl right thurr (Ooh), she make me say
Ooh, ooh (Yeah), ooh, ooh (Ayy)
Do what you do (C'mon)

I like the way you do that right thurr (Right thurr)
Switch your hips when you're walkin', let down your hurr (Down your hurr)
I like the way you do that right thurr (Right thurr)
Lick your lips when you're talkin', that make me sturr (Make me sturr)
I like the way you look in them pants, see ya fine (Fine)
Your momma a quarter piece, she far from a dime (Dime)
The type of girl that'll get'cha up and go make you grind (Grind)
I'm thinkin' about snatchin' her up, Dirty, makin' her mine
Look at her hips (What?), look at her legs, ain't she stacked? (Stacked)
I sure wouldn't mind hittin' that from the back (Back)
I like it when I touch it 'cause she moan a lil' bit
Jeans saggin' so I can see her thong a lil' bit
I know you grown a little bit, twenty years old, you legal
Don't trip off my people, just hop in the Regal
I swooped on her like an eagle swoop down on its prey
I know you popular, but you gonna be famous today, I say

I like the way you do that right thurr (Right thurr)
Switch your hips when you're walkin', let down your hurr (Down your hurr)
I like the way you do that right thurr (Right thurr)
Lick your lips when you're talkin', that make me sturr (Make me sturr)
I like the way you do that right thurr (Right thurr)
Switch your hips when you're walkin', let down your hurr (Down your hurr)
I like the way you do that right thurr (Right thurr)
Lick your lips when you're talkin', that make me sturr (Make me sturr)

She be shoppin' in Frontenac
Just look at her front and back
Man, she so stacked and she know that I want that
Her man, he's so wack, girl, can I taste yo cat?
Gave her three hundred to strip, like buyin' a throwback
She stay in the club, like to be seen, she got it honest
In real life, girl remind me of Pocahontas
She be at events (Yeah), cuss out the press when she pass (Yeah)
All the high rollin' cats wanna pay for that ass
Ain't no half steppin', she strapped with a nice weapon
Trick, it's against the law for her to move them hips
If you ever seen her dirty, your mouth gon' drop
Worldwide fools probably tell you this off tops
I like the way you do that right thurr (Right thurr)
Switch your hips when you're walkin', let down your hurr (Down your hurr)
I like the way you do that right thurr (Right thurr)
Lick your lips when you're talkin', that make me sturr (Make me sturr)
I like the way you do that right thurr (Right thurr)
Switch your hips when you're walkin', let down your hurr (Down your hurr)
I like the way you do that right thurr (Right thurr)
Lick your lips when you're talkin', that make me sturr (Make me sturr)

I like the way she doin' that (C'mon)
Plus I like it when she bring it back (Say it)
Ooh, (Uh-huh) ooh, ooh, ooh, (Uh-huh) do what you do (Woo)
I like the way she doin' that (C'mon)
Plus I like it when she bring it back (Say it)
Ooh, (Uh-huh) ooh, ooh, ooh, (Uh-huh) do what you do (Woo)

Gimme what you got for a pork chop
Uh, he threw it at me like I was a shortstop
Huh, workin' in a Fatty Girl Hugga Top
Then she back it up on me and let it drop (Drop)
Make it hop, boing, like a bunny (Bunny)
Girl, can I touch you where it's sunny?
Or a purse and make you give her some money
She should pose for Sports Illustrated
It's like a picture-perfect site
When she pass, all the other girls hate it
But I like the way you do that right thurr (Right thurr)
Switch your hips when you're walkin', let down your hurr (Down your hurr)
I like the way you do that right thurr (Right thurr)
Lick your lips when you're talkin', that make me sturr (Make me sturr)
I like the way you do that right thurr (Right thurr)
Switch your hips when you're walkin', let down your hurr (Down your hurr)
I like the way you do that right thurr (Right thurr)
Lick your lips when you're talkin', that make me sturr (Make me sturr)

Where's my pen? Bitch, I'm signin' (Signin')
I like those Balenciagas (Those)
The ones that look like socks
I like going to the jeweler
I put rocks all in my watch (Cha-ching)
I like texts from my exes when they want a second chance (What?)
I like proving niggas wrong, I do what they say I can't
They call me Cardi Bardi, banging body
Spicy mami, hot tamale
Hotter than a Somali, fur coat, Ferrari (Rrr, woo)
Hop out the stu', jump in the coupe (Coupe)
Big Dipper on top of the roof
Flexing on bitches as hard as I can
Eating halal, driving the Lam'
Told that bitch I'm sorry, though (Sorry, though)
'Bout my coins like Mario (Mario)

Look, my bitches all bad, my niggas all real

KSR
It's Cardi, ayy
Said I'm the shit, they can't fuck with me if they wanted to
I don't gotta dance

Said lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves (Ayy, ayy)
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves
Now she say she gon' do what to who? Let's find out and see
Cardi B, you know where I'm at, you know where I be
You in the club just to party, I'm there, I get paid a fee
I be in and out them banks so much, I know they're tired of me
Honestly, don't give a fuck 'bout who ain't fond of me
Dropped two mixtapes in six months
What bitch working as hard as me?
I don't bother with these hoes, don't let these hoes bother me
They see pictures, they say, "Goals," bitch, I'm who they tryna be
Look, I might just chill in some BAPE
I might just chill with your boo, I might just feel on your babe
My pussy feel like a lake
He wanna swim with his face, I'm like, "Okay"
I'll let him get what he want, he buy me Yves Saint Laurent
And the new whip, when I go fast as a horse
I got the trunk in the front (Vroom, vroom)
I'm the hottest in the street, know you prolly heard of me
Got a bag and fixed my teeth, hope you hoes know it ain't cheap
And I pay my mama bills, I ain't got no time to chill
Think these hoes be mad at me, their baby father run a bill

Said lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money moves
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves
If you a pussy, you get popped, you a goofy, you a opp
Don't you come around my way, you can't hang around my block
And I just checked my accounts, turns out, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich
I put my hand above my hip, I bet you dip, he dip, she dip
I say I get the money and go, this shit is hot like a stove
My pussy glitter is gold, tell that lil' bitch play her role
I just arrove in a Rolls, I just came up in a Wraith
I need to fill up the tank, no, I need to fill up the safe
I need to let all these hoes know that none of their niggas is safe
I go to dinner and steak, only the real can relate
I used to live in the P's, now it's a crib with a gate
Rollie got charms, look like Frosted Flakes
Had to let these bitches know, just in case these hoes forgot
I just run and check the mail, another check from Mona Scott

Said lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves304EmbedBetter Now Lyrics
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh
I did not believe that it would end, no
Everything came second to the Benzo
You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head

You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh

I seen you with your other dude
He seemed like he was pretty cool
I was so broken over you
Life, it goes on, what can you do?
I just wonder what it's gonna take (What's it gonna take?)
Another foreign or a bigger chain (Bigger chain)
Because no matter how my life has changed
I keep on looking back on better days
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh

I promise
I swear to you, I'll be okay
You're only the love of my life (Love of my life)

You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything

Ooh, I fall apart
Ooh, yeah, mmm, yeah

She told me that I'm not enough (Yeah)
And she left me with a broken heart (Yeah)
She fooled me twice and it's all my fault (Yeah)
She cut too deep, now she left me scarred (Yeah)
Now there's so many thoughts goin' through my brain (Yeah)
And now I'm takin' these shots like it's Novocaine, yeah
Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought

Never caught a feelin' this hard
Harder than the liquor I pour
Tell me you don't want me no more
But I can't let go, everybody told me so
Feelin' like I sold my soul
Devil in the form of a whore
Devil in the form of a whore
You said it, no, you said it
No, you said that shit, we'd be together, oh

Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought
Ice keep pourin' and the drink keep flowin'
Try to brush it off, but it keep on goin'
Covered in scars and I can't help showin'
Whippin' in the foreign and the tears keep rollin'
Ice keep droppin' and the drink keep flowin'
Try to brush it off, but it keep on goin'
All these scars, can't help from showin'
Whippin' in the foreign and the tears keep blowin', yeah

Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought207EmbedBarbie Dreams Lyrics
Uh, mmm, kyuh
R.I.P. to B.I.G. 
Classic shit

I'm lookin' for a nigga to give some babies
A handful of Weezy, sprinkle of Dave East
Man, I ain't got no type like Jxmmi and Swae Lees
But if he can't fuck three times a night, peace!
I tried to fuck 50 for a powerful hour
But all that nigga wanna do is talk Power for hours
B-beat the pussy up, make sure it's a K-O
Step your banks up like you're movin' that yayo
Somebody go and make sure Karrueche okay, though
I heard she think I'm tryna give the coochie to Quavo
They always wanna beat it up, goon up the pussy
Man, maybe I should let him autotune up the pussy
All these Bow Wow Challenge niggas lyin' and shit
Man, these Fetty Wap niggas stay eyein' my shit
Drake worth a hundred mill, he always buyin' me shit
But I don't know if the pussy wet or if he cryin' and shit
Meek still be in my DMs, I be havin' to duck him
"I used to pray for times like this" face-ass when I fuck him
Man, Uzi is my baby, he ain't takin' a L
But he took it literally when I said "Go to hell"
Used to fuck with Young Thug, I ain't addressin' this shit
C-caught him in my dressing room, stealin' dresses and shit
I used to give this nigga with a lisp tests and shit
How you want the pu-thy? Can't say your S's and shit, uh
Dreams of fuckin' one of these little rappers
I'm just playin', but I'm sayin' (Barbie dreams)
Dreams of fuckin' one of these little rappers
I'm just playin', but I'm sayin' (B-B-B-Barbie dreams)
Dreams of fuckin' one of these little rappers
I'm just playin', but I'm sayin' (B-B-B-Barbie, B-B-B-Barbie dreams)
Dreams of fuckin' one of these little rappers (Barbie dreams)
I'm just playin', but I'm sayin'

I remember when I used to have a crush on Special Ed
Shoutout Desiigner 'cause he made it out of special ed
You wanna fuck me, you gotta give some special head
'Cause this pussy have these niggas on some special meds
Like Mike Tyson, he was bitin' my shit
Talkin' 'bout, "Yo, why you got these niggas fightin' and shit?"
On the, on the real, I should make these niggas scrap for the pussy
Young M.A and Lady Luck, get the strap for this pussy, uh
And I woulda had Odell Beckham bangin' the cake
'Til I saw him hoppin' out of cars dancin' to Drake
I been a five-star bitch, man, word to Gotti
I'ma do that nigga Future dirty, word to Scottie
Had to cancel DJ Khaled, boy, we ain't speakin'
Ain't no fat nigga tellin' me what he ain't eatin'
YG and The Game with the hammer yellin', "Gang! Gang!"
This ain’t what I meant when I said a gang bang
Tekashi want a ménage, I said "tre-way"
Curved him and went the Kim and Kanye way
Em, cop the Barbie Dreamhouse, then you can play the part
I-I ain't tryna bust it open in a trailer park
Dreams of fuckin' one of these little rappers
I'm just playin', but I'm sayin' (Barbie dreams)
Dreams of fuckin' one of these little rappers
I'm just playin', but I'm sayin' (B-B-B-Barbie dreams)
Dreams of fuckin' one of these little rappers
I'm just playin', but I'm sayin' (B-B-B-Barbie, B-B-B-Barbie dreams)

I'm just playin', but I'm sayin' (B-B-B-Barbie dreams)

I'm just playin', but I'm sayin' (B-B-B-Barbie, B-B-B-Barbie dreams)

You know I'm all 'bout them dollars
I be supportin' them scholars
I let him give me some brain, but he wanted me to ride it
So I said, "Fuck it, I'm in"
He wanna cut like a trim
And if he act like he know, I let him fuck it again
I got them bars, I'm indicted
I'm poppin', I'm uninvited
I said, "Just lick on the clitoris, nigga, don't fuckin' bite it"
I ride his **** in a circle
I turn Stefan into Urkel
I go arounds and arounds and I'ma go down in slow motion
The-then I pick it up, look at it
I said, "Daddy, come get at it," uh
Yellow brick road, he said that I am a wiz at it
Yeah, they want it, want it
You know I flaunt it, flaunt it
I'm a trendsetter, everything I do, they do
Yeah, I put 'em up on it, on it
¡Dimelo, papi, papi!
Yo quiero sloppy, sloppy
I'll give it to you if you beat it up like Pacqui, Pacqui
I-I-I-I'ma kill 'em with the shoe
No ceiling is in the roof
And I'm big, give me the loot
12 cylinders in the coupe
I get dome with the chrome, no tellin' when I'ma shoot
I just bang, bang, bang, real killas is in my group
Gorillas is in my unit, vacationin' where it's humid
And I shine, shine, shine, got diamonds all in my cubans
I'm in LA Times more than when niggas lootin'
And my flow spit crack, I think that nigga usin'
He done bodied everybody, in closing, these bitches losin'
Usin', usin' up, a bitch movin'
No, I ain't stuttered and no, I ain't Ruben
Damn, a bitch snoozin'
Shoutout to my Jews, l'chaim, Rick Rubin
Big fat titties, yes, they be protrudin'
I be like, fuck 'em, fuck 'em, bring the lube in
I be like, fuck 'em, fuck 'em, bring the lube in148EmbedOnly Lyrics
Yo
I never fucked Wayne, I never fucked Drake
On my life, man, fuck's sake
If I did, I'd ménage with 'em
And let 'em eat my ass like a cupcake
My man full, he just ate
I don't duck nobody but tape
Yeah, that was a setup
For a punchline on duct tape
Wo-wo-wo-worried 'bout if my butt fake
Worry 'bout y'all niggas, us straight
Th-these girls are my sons
Jo-Jon & Kate Plus Eight
When I walk in, sit up straight
I don't give a fuck if I was late
Dinner with my man on a G5
Is my idea of a update
Hut-hut one, hut-hut two
Big titties, big butt too
Fu-fuck with them real niggas
Who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is
Ri-ring finger where the rock is
The-these hoes couldn't test me
Even if their name was Pop Quiz
Bad bitches who I fuck with
Ma-ma-mad bitches we don't fuck with
I don't fuck with them chickens
Unless they last name is Cutlet
Let it soak in
Like seasoning
And tell them bitches blow me
Lance Stephenson
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it, be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

Yeah, I never fucked Nicki 'cause she got a man
But when that's over, then I'm first in line
And the other day in her Maybach
I thought, "Goddamn, this is the perfect time"
We had just come from that video
You know, L.A. traffic, how the city slow
She was sitting down on that big butt, but I was still staring at the titties though
Yeah, low-key or maybe high-key
I been peeped that you like me, you know?
Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?
I mean, it doesn't take much for us to do this shit quietly
I mean, she say I'm obsessed with thick women and I agree
Yeah, that's right, I like my girls BBW
Yeah, type that wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you
Yeah, so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Clair Huxtable
Oh! Yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
The NBA players fuck with you
The bad-ass bitches doing makeup and hair fuck with you, oh
That's 'cause I believe in something, I stand for it
And Nicki if you ever tryna fuck
Just give me the heads-up, so I can plan for it

I never fucked Nick' and that's fucked up
If I did fuck, she'd be fucked up
Whoever is hittin' ain't hittin' it right
'Cause she act like she need dick in her life
That's another story, I'm no story-teller
I piss greatness, like goldish yellow
All my goons so overzealous
I'm from Hollygrove, the holy Mecca
Calendar say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend will beat a bitch up if she waved
They bet' not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? Take mothers instead
You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp, boy, treat beef like sirloin
I'm talkin' 'bout runnin' in houses with army guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes with me, masked up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' 'bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is crazy, my nigga
I mean brazy, my nigga
That money talk, I just rephrase it, my nigga
Blood gang, take the "b" off behavior, my nigga
For reals, if you mouth off, I blow your face off
I mean "pop-pop-pop," then I take off
Nigga, now you see me, nigga, now you don't
Like Jamie Foxx acting like Ray Charles
Sixteen in a clip, one in the chamber
17 Ward bully with seventeen bullets
My story is how I went from "poor me"
To "please pour me a drink and celebrate with me"
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it, be quiet
Young Mula, baby!
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only1.9KEmbedRockin’ Around The Christmas Tree Lyrics
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple tries to stop

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing, "Let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly!"

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way


You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing, "Let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly!"

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way9EmbedRudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer Lyrics
You know Dasher and Dancer, Prancer and Vixen
Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen
But do you recall (what's that?)
The most famous reindeer of all?
(Come on)

Rudolph the Rednose Reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows (come on, come on)
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games
Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say (what's that?)
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?

Then all the reindeers loved him
As they shouted out with glee
Rudolph, the Rednose Reindeer
You'll go down in history (forever)
You'll go down in history (forever)
You'll go down in histor-
You'll go down in histor-
You'll go down in history (now get it)

(What's that?)

Then all the reindeers loved him
As they shouted out with glee
Rudolph, the Rednose Reindeer
You'll go down in history (forever)
You'll go down in history (forever)
You'll go down in histor-
You'll go down in histor-
You'll go down in history (now get it)2EmbedAll I Want for Christmas (Is My Two Front Teeth) LyricsAll I want for Christmas
