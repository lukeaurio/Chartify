I Can’t Help Myself (Sugar Pie, Honey Bunch) Lyrics
Uuh

Sugar pie, honey bunch
You know that I love you
I can't help myself
I love you and nobody else

In and out my life (In and out my life)
You come and you go (You come and you go)
Leaving just your picture behind
And I've kissed it a thousand times
When you snap your finger or wink your eye
I come a-running to you
I'm tied to your apron strings (Can't help myself)
And there's nothing that I can do, ooh

Can't help myself (Ooh)
No, I can't help myself (Ooh)
'Cause, sugar pie, honey bunch (Sugar pie, honey bunch)
I'm weaker than a man should be
I can't help myself
I'm a fool in love, you see

Wanna tell you I don't love you
Tell you that we're through
And I've tried
But every time I see your face (I can't help myself)
I get all choked up inside

When I call your name
Girl, it starts the flame
(Burning in my heart, tearing it all apart)
No matter how I try, my love I cannot hide
'Cause sugar pie, honey bunch (Sugar pie, honey bunch)
You know that I'm weak for you (Weak for you)
Can't help myself
I love you and nobody else (Ooh)
Sugar pie, honey bunch (Sugar pie, honey bunch)
Do anything you ask me to (Ask me to)
Can't help myself
I want you and nobody else (Ooh)
Sugar pie, honey bunch (Sugar pie, honey bunch)
You know that I love you (Love you)
I can't help myself
No, I can't help myself (Ooh)
Sugar pie, honey bunch (Sugar pie, honey bunch)
You know that I love you1Embed
