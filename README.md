# Chartify
A simple app used to show the Emotional flow of albums and playlists
Based off of an Idea by RCharlie https://www.rcharlie.com/post/fitter-happier/
Will connect to Spotify and use Chart.js in order to create and build charts
Can be used to graph and analyze albums, songs and (eventually) playlists 
for their emotional highs and lows for proper playlist development.
will eventually allow creation of playlists via Spotify's User API
